# Compression methods to achive high compression on compressed data
> **Note:** 
> * This won't work for all file types and could result in a compressed file size larger than the initial file size.
> * The process can take from a few mintues to several DAYS! so make sure that you have your device running while the files are being compressed. 
> * The process may alter the context of your file after each step. 
> * To ensure data security please run checksums and backup you data before performing any actions listed below.
## Method 1 
>This method uses the free arc compression software that has been disontinued and thus require the wayback machine to download from.
### Free Arc
"FreeArc is a free and open-source high-performance file archiver developed by Bulat Ziganshin. The project is presumably discontinued, since no information has been released by the developers since 2016 and the official website is down." (source google)
Free arc is an amazing compression software that comes with compression algorithms which result in outstadingly high compression ratios compared to Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm or LZMA used by softwares like 7zip and Win RAR; at the cost of high compression and uncompression times.
Free arc also supports a command line tool so that we can use it to make interfaces with c++ or use tools like Innosetup.
To start firstly install free arc from the wayback machine [Download](archive.org).
